# Directory-Project

Greetings!!

This is a simple Telephone directory project that stores the telephone number, mobile number, email address and home address of any name of the person you enter the data in. All the data you enter will be asked and stored in the database.
This project uses the MY-SQL database my oracle. So make sure to change your password while downloading the file and before executing the code according to your own password of mysql.

I have used tkinter module to represent the data. So all the display and entry will be done in a small tkinter widget applet.

For the images to display in the applet I have used Pillow library (pip install Pillow) and used in code as PIL
Again to represent the data in the tabular format I have used tabulate library (pip install tabulate). This is a module usually used to display all the data in a tabular format.
Any type of data can be presented using this module.

Also do make sure to change the directory of the images being accessed as you will see in the code. 



This was the project I made during the lockdown and as a school project for class 12.

Any type of suggestions or improvement for this project would be welcome.
